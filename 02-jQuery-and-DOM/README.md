# Class 2 - jQuery and the DOM

## Today's Plan

Song for the day: ["Log Commercial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQGPZTECYs) from the Ren & Stimpy Show (for us, it'll be "Blog"...)

```
What's made with code,
deployed with Node,
and makes your brain turn to fog?
What's worked on in labs,
Has nav made with tabs?
It's blog, blog, blog

It's blog, it's blog,
Write every day, you should.
It's blog, it's blog, it's better than bad, it's good.

Everyone wants a blog
You're gonna love it, blog
Come on and get your blog
Everyone needs a blog
blog blog blog

*whistle*
BLOG FROM BLAMMO
```
